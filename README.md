This is sponsored by 연세대학교 RC교육원xNexon team '빛을 놓지 않는 사람들'

For this project, we design website with html, JS, and python.

Although 20 thousand people use naver cafe name '빛을 놓지 않는 사람들', it has many drawbacks like uncomofortable design and lack of searching function.

So, we use html, and JS to make website more comfortable by making bigger font, simple interface and black background.

Also, we want to develop searching engine by using python crawling selenium. However, it is not effective than searching function of that.

Earnings of using python is we can use the previous website content.
